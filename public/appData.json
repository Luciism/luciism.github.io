      "content": "Growing up, I was always fascinated by the world of technology, I had so many questions. Everything seemed like magic, however with restricted access to technology, I didn't get many answers.\n\nIt was only when I was a teenager that I started getting answers to those burning questions. I started getting into programming topics and was invested. I loved learning new concepts and was always ready for a new challenge."

      "content": "I am currently interested in building well structured backend systems, as well as building out smaller scale projects that leverage existing UIs of established platforms such as Discord. I also enjoy tinkering with frontend tools whenever I need to create a UI for one of my projects.\n\nMoving forward, I would like to focus more on concepts such as machine learning and cybersecurity. I would also like to familiarise myself with some languages such as Rust and Go, as well as lower level languages such as C."
